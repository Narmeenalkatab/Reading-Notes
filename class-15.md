## What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?


Key characteristics of serverless computing and differences from traditional server-based architectures:
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Key characteristics include:
Event-driven: Functions are triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or file uploads.
Automatic scaling: Resources are allocated as needed, scaling up or down based on the incoming workload.
Pay-per-use pricing: Users are charged based on the actual usage, typically in terms of function invocations and execution time.
No server management: Developers can focus on writing code without the need to provision, configure, or manage servers.
Stateless: Functions are stateless and designed to be independent units of work, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.
In contrast, traditional server-based architectures involve manually provisioning and managing servers to handle incoming requests. Scaling is typically done by adding or removing servers manually, and users are charged for the provisioned server resources rather than the actual usage.



## How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
Getting started with Vercel and deploying a serverless function:
To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, follow these main steps:
Step 1: Sign up and create a Vercel account.
Step 2: Install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine.
Step 3: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the command line.
Step 4: Initialize a new project using the Vercel CLI: vercel init.
Step 5: Choose your project type (e.g., Next.js, static, etc.) and configure the project settings.
Step 6: Write your serverless function code and place it in the appropriate directory within your project.
Step 7: Deploy the project using the Vercel CLI: vercel deploy.
Step 8: Follow the prompts to configure your deployment settings and choose a unique URL for your deployment.
Step 9: Once the deployment is complete, you can access your serverless function via the assigned URL.

Vercel provides detailed documentation and tutorials on their website that can guide you through the process.




## What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?


APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and their utilization in Python applications:
APIs are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. They provide a way to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as web services, databases, or other applications. In Python, APIs can be utilized using various libraries, such as Requests or built-in libraries like urllib.
Python applications can make HTTP requests to API endpoints, receive responses in various formats (JSON, XML, etc.), and parse the data for further processing. APIs can be used to retrieve data, submit data, perform actions, or integrate services into your application.


## What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library in Python and an example of a basic GET request:
The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of interacting with web services and APIs. To use the Requests library, you need to install it first by running pip install requests.


ex:

```import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # Process the retrieved data
    print(data)
else:
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)
```
