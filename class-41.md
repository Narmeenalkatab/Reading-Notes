## Dynamic Routes vs. Static Routes in Next.js

Dynamic routes in Next.js allow for creating pages with variable parts in the URL. This is useful for generating content-driven pages like blog posts. Dynamic routes are defined using files with brackets (e.g., `[slug].js`) in the `pages` directory. The dynamic parameter can be accessed using the `useRouter` hook. Pages can be generated at build time or on request.

Static routes, on the other hand, have fixed URLs and separate files (e.g., `about.js`) in the `pages` directory. They are generated at build time and remain unchanged until the next build.

## Deploying a Next.js Application

To deploy a Next.js application, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**: Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build.

2. **Choose a Deployment Platform**: Select a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.

3. **Connect Repository**: Connect the deployment platform to your Git repository.

4. **Configure Build Settings**: Set up build commands, environment variables, and other settings.

5. **Deploy**: Trigger deployment either manually or automatically on each commit.

Common deployment platforms include Vercel, Netlify, and AWS Amplify.

## Static File Serving in Next.js

Next.js handles static file serving through the `public` directory. Static assets like images or stylesheets are placed in this folder. They are served directly by the server and don't go through the Next.js routing.

To reference static assets:

- Images: Place them in `public/images` and use `/images/image-name.jpg` in your components.
- Stylesheets: Put them in `public/styles` and use `/styles/style.css` in your components.

Using the `/` prefix ensures that the assets are served from the root of your application.
