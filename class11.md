## What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Lab is an enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook with a more flexible and powerful user interface. It offers a multi-document interface, integrated tools, and customization options through extensions. Jupyter Lab allows for efficient code editing, simultaneous work on multiple notebooks, and a streamlined development process. It is a versatile environment for interactive computing and data analysis tasks.


## What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

NumPy is a powerful library for scientific computing in Python. Its main functionalities include efficient handling of multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical operations, array manipulation, and broadcasting. NumPy enables efficient and vectorized computations, memory optimization, and seamless integration with other scientific Python libraries. It is essential for tasks involving numerical computations and data manipulation, making Python programming more efficient and convenient for scientific and data-related tasks.



## Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

Creating an array:


```import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create a 2D array
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```

Accessing elements:


```# Access individual elements
print(arr1d[0])  # Output: 1
print(arr2d[1, 2])  # Output: 6

# Slicing arrays
print(arr1d[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(arr2d[:, 1:])  # Output: [[2, 3], [5, 6]]
```

Manipulating arrays:


```# Reshaping arrays
reshaped_arr = arr1d.reshape((2, 2))
print(reshaped_arr)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Combining arrays
combined_arr = np.concatenate((arr1d, arr2d.flatten()))
print(combined_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Applying mathematical operations
result = arr1d * 2 + 3
print(result)  # Output: [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
```
