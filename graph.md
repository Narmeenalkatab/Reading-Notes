 # Undirected graph and

An undirected graph consists of nodes connected by edges without any direction. Each node can have neighboring nodes. Represented as an adjacency list, each node's list contains its connected neighbors. For example, in a graph with nodes A, B, and C connected as (A-B) and (B-C), the adjacency list would be: A: [B], B: [A, C], C: [B].
