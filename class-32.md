# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions

DRF Permissions are essential components that secure APIs. They control access based on user roles and permissions. Key parts include authentication, permission classes, and authorization. By using these, you can restrict access to specific views or actions, ensuring only authorized users can interact with protected resources.

# SQL SELECT Statement

In SQL, the SELECT statement retrieves data from tables. To get all columns from the 'employees' table, you'd use:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

# DRF Generic Views

DRF Generic Views simplify building RESTful APIs. They provide shortcuts for common tasks like listing objects, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting. Examples include ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView, CreateAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView. These views handle different HTTP methods and promote code reusability.
