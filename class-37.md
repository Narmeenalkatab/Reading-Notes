#### Tailwind CSS: Utility Classes

**Purpose of Utility Classes:**
Utility classes in Tailwind CSS provide pre-defined styles that can be directly applied to HTML elements. They streamline the styling process, reducing the need for custom CSS while maintaining consistent design patterns.

#### Next.js Advantages and Comparison

**Main Advantages of Next.js:**
1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Faster initial page loads, improved SEO, and enhanced user experience.
2. **Automatic Code Splitting:** Optimized performance by loading only required JavaScript for each page.
3. **Server-Side Data Fetching:** Fetch data on the server before rendering, reducing client-side requests and enhancing performance.

**Comparison with Traditional Client-Side Rendering (CSR):**
In traditional CSR, all rendering is done on the client, which can lead to slower initial page loads, less SEO friendliness, and challenges in data fetching. Next.js's SSR approach addresses these issues by rendering pages on the server, resulting in better performance and SEO outcomes.
