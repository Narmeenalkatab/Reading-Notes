its implementation using Python's Scikit-Learn library, and the purpose of splitting a dataset into train and test sets.
Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the dependent variable can be approximated as a linear combination of the independent variables. The purpose of linear regression is to predict or estimate the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

##  what is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

Purpose of Splitting the Dataset:
Splitting the dataset into train and test sets is crucial for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. Here's why it's important:
a. Performance evaluation:
By keeping a portion of the data separate for testing, you can assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. If you evaluate the model on the same data used for training, it may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training set but fails to generalize to new data. The test set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.

b. Assessing generalization ability:
The test set acts as a proxy for new, unseen data. It helps you determine if the model has learned meaningful patterns or if it is merely memorizing the training data. A model that performs well on the test set is more likely to generalize well to real-world scenarios.

c. Hyperparameter tuning:
Splitting the data allows you to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, such as regularization strength, learning rate, or the number of iterations, without introducing bias. You can iteratively adjust the hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance on the test set to select the optimal settings.
