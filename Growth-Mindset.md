## Read Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. (10 minutes)

To improve your hard technical skills, deliberate practice is necessary. Deliberate practice involves activities designed to improve specific aspects of one's performance, pushed just outside their comfort zone, repeated often, with feedback continuously available. It's highly demanding mentally, difficult, and requires good goals. Challenges should be set to teach something new, surmountable, and mentally exhausting to upgrade one's skills.
