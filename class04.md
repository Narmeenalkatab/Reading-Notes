__1-What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?__
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that defines the attributes and methods that the objects will have. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class that contain their own data and behavior.
__2-Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?__
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until a specific condition is met.

 For example, the factorial of 3 is  3 x 2 x 1 = 6.

 def factorial(n):


    if n == 0:


        return 1


    else:


        return n * factorial(n-1)



__3-What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.__

Fixtures can be used to create objects or data structures that are needed for a particular test function.
