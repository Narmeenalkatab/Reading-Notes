__What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers.__

The basic syntax of Python list comprehension is:

```new_list = [expression for item in list]```

-expression is the operation

-item represents  elements.

-list is the iterable from which the new list will be created.

example :

```original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_list = [x**2 for x in original_list]

print(squared_list)```
output [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


**What is a decorator in Python?**

**Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading.**


A decorator in Python is a way to modify the behavior of a function or class without directly changing its source code. Decorators allow you to wrap a function or class with additional functionality by defining a separate function, known as a decorator function, and applying it to the target function or class using the @decorator_name syntax.

Decorators work by taking the decorated object as an input, modifying it or adding some behavior, and returning a new object or function that incorporates the changes. They provide a way to extend or enhance the functionality of existing functions or classes without modifying their original implementation.
ex:

```def uppercase_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        result = func()
        return result.upper()
    return wrapper

@uppercase_decorator
def greet():
    return "hello"

print(greet())```
output HELLO
